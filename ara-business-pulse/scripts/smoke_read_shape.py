"""WS4 — install / first-run smoke for the apple-mail read path.

DEFAULT (offline) mode closes the MCP-serialization gap: read_apple_mail returns
the documented dict shape and is JSON-serializable (the MCP layer serializes the
return to JSON, so a non-serializable field would only surface over the wire). It
runs WITHOUT the live MCP SDK and WITHOUT touching Apple Mail (a tiny in-process
fake) and WITHOUT writing the real marker/run-log (temp dir).

--live mode (Derick runs this post-publish; NEEDS real Mail + TCC) is the cap's
boundary/completeness/SPEED probe (R-SAFE):
  * SPEED — times a real read; the ~90s per-account timeout should be gone.
  * BOUNDARY DECISION — with an account name, it reads that ONE account directly and
    prints examined / total / boundary_in_window / in-window record count and the
    resulting saturated/CAPPED verdict. This exercises the boundary DECISION itself,
    not just "did the pulse return something".
  * No per-account timeout (accounts_failed empty) is the primary PASS signal.
CAVEAT: a healthy-looking returned/message count does NOT prove completeness — the
silent-miss class is an account that SHOULD be capped but isn't; watch
`accounts_capped` and the boundary verdict, not the raw count.
It uses a recent (3-day) cutoff and temp marker/log paths (never the real marker).

Run:
    python3 ara-business-pulse/scripts/smoke_read_shape.py                     # offline
    python3 ara-business-pulse/scripts/smoke_read_shape.py --live             # full read
    python3 ara-business-pulse/scripts/smoke_read_shape.py --live "iCloud"    # + boundary

Exit 0 = PASS, 1 = FAIL/CHECK.
