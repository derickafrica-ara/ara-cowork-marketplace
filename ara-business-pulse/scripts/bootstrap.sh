# ara-business-pulse — first-run dependency bootstrap (SessionStart hook).
#
# The bundled apple-mail MCP server has ONE runtime dependency: the MCP Python
# SDK (mcp>=1.2.0, see apple-mail/requirements.txt). This installs it ONCE into a
# persistent venv under ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}, reinstalling only when the bundled
# requirements.txt changes (the canonical diff-stamp pattern from
# code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins-reference). .mcp.json points the apple-mail
# server's `command` at ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/venv/bin/python3, so this venv must
# exist before the server first starts — the SessionStart hook guarantees that.
#
# Trimmed from the proven Falke bootstrap pattern: NO Chromium/Playwright step
# (this server has no such dependency) and no render-mode marker. Pure-Python dep
# only.
#
# Idempotent and quiet on the happy path. Floyd reviews this for the execution
# threat model before ship, like the bid-tools one.
