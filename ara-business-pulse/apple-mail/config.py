"""Configuration for the Apple Mail draft MCP server.

COND-6 recipient-domain allow-list lives here. An injection cannot draft to an
arbitrary stranger: every recipient (to + cc) must be on an allow-listed domain.

The allow-list is configurable via the env var APPLE_MAIL_DRAFT_ALLOWED_DOMAINS
(comma-separated), falling back to the ARA default. Keep it conservative —
this is the control that bounds the worst-case recipient of a fully
injection-controlled run (Floyd's §2.1, the one residual he "will not hand-wave").
