"""read_core — the security-critical core of the Apple Mail READ tool.

Read side of the CoS morning scan. Mirrors draft_core's hardening discipline and
shares the same osascript-arg-safety machinery (static .applescript + list argv,
shell=False). Kept separate from MCP transport (server.py) so the full read test
suite runs WITHOUT the MCP SDK and WITHOUT driving Mail.app (fake driver).

Conditions implemented here:
  COND-8  (account allow-list — the privacy control). read_apple_mail() lists
          accounts (list_accounts.applescript: name + email, NO message read),
          matches each account's email DOMAIN against the allow-list, and only
          THEN reads the inbox of an ALLOW-LISTED account. A non-allow-listed
          account (e.g. a personal Gmail) is NEVER passed to the read script —
          enforcement is at the account boundary, BEFORE any message is read,
          by construction (not filter-after-read). Fail closed: empty/garbage
          allow-list => read NOTHING. Every account read/skip is logged.
  COND-7  (AppleScript string-injection). The account name + cutoff go to
          osascript as ARGUMENTS (list argv, shell=False) read by `on run argv`,
          never interpolated into AppleScript source — same as the draft tool.
  bounded-delta. read_account.applescript scans ONLY the named account's INBOX,
          filtered `whose date received > cutoff`. Never every mailbox of every
          account (the ~500x-slower, Mail-stalling pattern).
  cached-body integrity. A message present in the delta window but with a blank/
          partial body (cached/not-yet-downloaded) is SKIPPED + logged — never
          returned as if it were the real message.
  COND-5  (fail-loud + run-log). osascript timeout / error / Mail-not-running
          fails LOUD (raises) and writes a read-log entry; never silently returns
          an empty/partial scan as success.
  COND-2  READ-ONLY. The only Mail operations are property reads + a `whose`
          filter (in the two static read scripts). No write/draft/delete/move/
          mark verb. ReadMailDriver exposes only list_accounts + read_inbox.
